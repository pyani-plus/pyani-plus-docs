# `delete-run` {#delete-run-subcommand.unnambered}

The `delete-run` subcommand deletes any single run stored in the database. This will prompt the user for confirmation if the run has comparisons, or if the run status is "Running", but that can be overridden.


```shell
 $ pyani-plus delete-run -h
                                                                                     
 Usage: pyani-plus delete-run [OPTIONS]                                              
                                                                                     
 Delete any single run from the given pyANI-plus SQLite3 database.                   
 This will prompt the user for confirmation if the run has comparisons, or if the    
 run status is "Running", but that can be overridden.                                
 Currently this will *not* delete any linked comparisons, even if they are not       
 currently linked to another run. They will be reused should you start a new run     
 using an overlapping set of input FASTA files.
