# `delete-run` {#delete-run-subcommand.unnambered}

The `delete-run` subcommand deletes any single run stored in the database. This will prompt the user for confirmation if the run has comparisons, or if the run status is "Running", but that can be overridden.


::: { .callout-important}
Currently this will *not* delete any linked comparisons, even if they are not currently linked to another run. They will be reused should you start a new run using an overlapping set of input FASTA files.
