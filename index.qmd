- ANIb (average nucleotide identity using BLAST+)
- ANIm (average nucleotide identity using MUMmer)
- dnadiff (average nucleotide identity using dnadiff)
- fastANI (average nucleotide identity using fastANI)
- sourmash (average nucleotide identity using sourmash)
- extenral-alignment (average nucletide identity using multiple-sequence-alignment)
