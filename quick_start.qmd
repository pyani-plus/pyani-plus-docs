## Output files
The expected outputs in `pyANI-plus` can vary depending on the specific command used. At present, the software generates both graphical and tabular outputs:

- __Graphical Outputs__: These include plots such as heatmaps, distributions, and scatter plots, which are available in popular formats like `PDF`, `PNG`, `JPG` and `SVGZ`.
- __Tabular Outputs__: `pyANI-plus` also produces matrices that display ANI (Average Nucleotide Identity) results, along with classification data,  provided in tab-separated .tsv format.
